<h1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1>

<div class="legal_content">
    <h3><a name="effectiveDate"></a>1. Parties and Effective Date</h3>
    <p class="bold caps">THIS BUYER AGREEMENT (“AGREEMENT”) IS BETWEEN KNN Creative, INC. (“KNN Creative”) AND YOU AS A USER OF THE KNN Creative SITE AND SERVICES WHO IS SUBSCRIBING TO OR OTHERWISE USING THE KNN Creative SITE AND SERVICES (“BUYER” OR “YOU”), WHETHER OR NOT YOU ACTUALLY ACCEPT ANY PROPOSALS OR BUY ANY GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANY OTHER KNN Creative USER. YOUR USE OF THE KNN Creative WEBSITE, LOCATED AT HTTPS://KNNCreative.COM (THE “SITE”) AND ANY OTHER KNN Creative SERVICES, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND KNN Creative’S PRIVACY POLICY, (COLLECTIVELY, THE “BUYER TERMS AND CONDITIONS”).</p>
    <p class="bold caps">THIS VERSION OF THE BUYER AGREEMENT WAS IMPLEMENTED AND BECAME EFFECTIVE ON NOVEMBER 07, 2016 (“EFFECTIVE DATE”). IT APPLIES FROM THE LATER OF THAT DATE AND THE DATE ON WHICH YOU ACCEPTED IT THROUGH THE SITE.</p>

    <h3><a name="purposeKNN Creative"></a>2. Purpose of KNN Creative</h3>
    <p>KNN Creative has created an online marketplace to connect makers of custom and handmade goods and providers of custom services (“Makers” and, together with you and other buyers or potential buyers, “Users”), with users who wish to shop for and purchase custom and handmade goods and services. On and through the Site, you and others may post requests to invite proposals from Makers for custom goods or services (“Project Requests”) or order items directly. Makers may post information about their skills and past projects in their profiles and submit proposals in response to Project Requests (“Project Proposals”). Once a proposal is accepted or order is made, you and Makers can communicate with each other to form an agreement whereby a Maker will create and deliver a custom good or service (a “Project”) to you (a “Project Agreement”). KNN Creative makes no guaranty, representation, or assurance that a Project Agreement will be legally enforceable if challenged.</p>

    <p>Prior to your entering into a given Project Agreement, KNN Creative shall have the right (but in no event any obligation) to reject any Project Agreement by notifying the parties thereto that they may not enter into the proposed Project Agreement.</p>

    <h3><a name="generalPerformance">6.  General Buyer Performance</a></h3>
    <p>KNN Creative expects a consistent and high level of courtesy, respect and professionalism from all of its Users toward each other.</p>
    <p>When Buyer accepts a proposal from another User that results in a Project Agreement, Buyer agrees and intends that by doing so, Buyer is entering into a binding agreement directly with that User, which Buyer will honor. KNN Creative is not a party to any Project Agreement or other agreements between or among Users. Buyer understands and agrees that the Maker with which Buyer enters into a Project Agreement, not KNN Creative, will be the merchant of record for all transactions through the Site.</p>
    <p>Buyer shall not enter into any Project Agreement with terms that would cause Buyer to violate any of the provisions of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>Buyer agrees to promptly deliver payment to the Maker in accordance with the terms of any Project Agreement unless the Maker fails to meet the material terms of the Project Agreement.</p>
    <p>Buyer agrees to use good judgment when posting information, comments, feedback or other content regarding other Users, KNN Creative, or any third party anywhere within the Site. User may be held legally responsible for damages suffered by other Users, KNN Creative or any third party as a result of legally actionable or defamatory comments, remarks or other information or content posted to the Site.</p>
    <p>Buyer shall not post to the Site or include in any communications with another User, information that is libelous, defamatory, obscene, abusive, pornographic, threatening, inaccurate, or an invasion of privacy; an infringement of another’s intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, copyrights and trademarks; illegal in any way or that advocates illegal activity under any applicable law; an advertisement or solicitation of funds, goods, or services, other than for the purpose of conducting business with other Users pursuant to the purpose of the Site as stated in Section 2; an impersonation of another; or personal information of another, including but not limited to personal phone numbers, account numbers, personal addresses, or employer references.</p>
    <p>Buyer agrees that KNN Creative is not and shall not be legally responsible for any remarks, information, or other content posted or made available on the Site by any other User or third party, even if such information or content is defamatory or otherwise legally actionable. KNN Creative is not responsible for and does not monitor or censor content for accuracy. KNN Creative reserves the right, however, to remove or restrict access to any information or content posted or made available on the Site if ordered to do so by a court, if KNN Creative considers such information or content to be inappropriate, or for any other reason, in its sole discretion.</p>
    <p>All identity information associated with the Buyer and Buyer’s account on the Site must be real and verifiable. Buyer shall at all times ensure that the information associated with the Buyer’s account is accurate and updated. KNN Creative may validate Buyer information at any time. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with any such verification efforts, including but not limited to providing to KNN Creative upon request government or legal documents that confirm the Buyer’s identity.</p>
    <p>Buyer is solely responsible for ensuring and maintaining the secrecy and security of Buyer’s account information and password. Buyer agrees not to disclose Buyer’s password to, or allow the use of Buyer’s account by, any third party. Buyer agrees that Buyer shall be solely responsible for any use of the Buyer’s account or Buyer’s password, whether or not Buyer authorizes such use.</p>
    <p>Buyer authorizes KNN Creative to run credit card authorizations on any credit cards provided by Buyer. Buyer may terminate KNN Creative membership and disable the Buyer’s account at any time. Buyer shall, however, remain bound by the terms of this Agreement even if Buyer disables Buyer’s account.</p>

    <h3><a name="userCommunication">7.  Communications with Users</a></h3>
    <p>All written communications relating to Projects, transactions, or potential transactions between Buyer and any other User must be conducted through the Site. All such communications must be in English and may not contain any requests to circumvent the Site.</p>
    <p>Buyer shall immediately notify KNN Creative if another User communicates in writing with Buyer other than through the Site.</p>
    <p>When engaged in communications concerning Projects, transactions, or potential transactions with other Users, Buyer shall regularly review and respond promptly to communications from such Users.</p>

    <h3><a name="projectRequest">8.  Posting A Project Request</a></h3>
    <p>Project Requests must be of a professional nature and accurately describe the good or service requested. They should be free of offensive language or advertisements for other products or services. Project Requests may not request any good or service that is illegal or the provision of which would infringe upon any third party’s intellectual property or other rights.</p>


    <h3><a name="disintermediation">9.  Disintermediation</a></h3>
    <p>Disintermediation, as used in this Agreement, means Buyer’s conducting outside of the Site or through any channels other than those provided or specified by KNN Creative any transaction with another User to whom Buyer was introduced through or as a result of Buyer’s use of the Site. Buyer shall not engage in Disintermediation or request that another User engage in Disintermediation.</p>
    <p>Buyer shall immediately notify KNN Creative if another User requests that Buyer engage in Disintermediation.</p>

    <h3><a name="payments">10.  Payments</a></h3>
    <p>Buyer agrees that for all Projects for which Buyer is required to make payment to another User, all payments are to be made and accepted only through a payment mechanism provided or approved by KNN Creative (an “Approved Payment Mechanism”). Buyer shall immediately notify KNN Creative if another User requests that Buyer make a payment by any method other than an Approved Payment Mechanism.</p>
    <p>Buyer shall, at Buyer’s own expense, take all steps necessary to enable Buyer to make payments through at least one Approved Payment Mechanism, including but not limited to, as applicable, acquiring necessary computer equipment and software, establishing an account with a third-party payment processor, and providing credit card and bank account information.</p>
    <p>To the extent an Approved Payment Mechanism involves the use of a KNN Creative-approved third-party payment processor (“Payment Processor”), KNN Creative may make available, for the convenience of Users, the ability to communicate with and make payments using the Payment Processor through Site. Buyer understands and agrees to the following with respect to any Approved Payment Mechanism, whether or not it involves a Payment Processor, and whether or not KNN Creative provides a User with the ability to access or use a Payment Processor’s services through the Site: (a) KNN Creative does not oversee or control the receipt or transfer of payments; (b) KNN Creative shall have no responsibility or liability for any losses or damages relating to or arising out of the receipt or transmission of payments, including but not limited to losses or damages from misdirected or lost payments, breaches of security, chargebacks, fraud, theft of funds, violations of banking, money-laundering, privacy, or any other laws relating to or arising out of the use of an Approved Payment Mechanism; (c) Buyer shall comply with all terms and conditions imposed by any Payment Processor; (d) Buyer shall be responsible for and shall pay any fees charged to Buyer by a Payment Processor, credit card network, bank, or other financial institution, or otherwise imposed on Buyer as a result of payments made or received through an Approved Payment Mechanism; and (e) Buyer consents to KNN Creative or the Payment Processor deducting from any payment made by Buyer, and paying to KNN Creative, amounts that are due from Buyer to KNN Creative, or delaying the transfer of funds when amounts are due from Maker, whether such amounts are the result of the Project for which the payment is received or otherwise. Nothing herein is intended to limit any rights you may have against a Payment Processor.</p>
    <p>All pricing and payments are in U.S. Dollars.</p>

    <h3><a name="cmFees">11.  KNN Creative Fees</a></h3>
    <p>Buyer understands and agrees that KNN Creative charges fees (“Fees”) for KNN Creative’s services and technology provided through the Site and otherwise.  This includes but is not limited to: a transaction-based service fee (the “Service Fee”) for Users that enter into a Project Agreement and a Project Request fee (the “Project Request Fee”) for Buyers issuing a Project Request. The Service Fee is charged to any Maker with which Buyer enters into a Project Agreement and is disclosed to the Maker in that agreement.</p>
    <p>The Service Fee shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per Project.</p>
    <p>For each Project, the Service Fee shall be due immediately upon Buyer’s first payment pursuant to the Project Agreement, although KNN Creative may, at its sole discretion, opt to defer all or a portion of the Service Fee for a given Project until Buyer makes final payment for that Project.</p>
    <p>KNN Creative shall have the right to collect the KNN Creative Service Fee directly from the funds that Buyer provides to the Maker through an Approved Payment Mechanism.</p>
    <p>From time to time, KNN Creative may, at its sole discretion, choose to offer Users discounts on Fees or a credit towards Fees. Unless KNN Creative states in writing otherwise, all Fees are final and nonrefundable.</p>
    <p>Fees are not limited to those listed above.  KNN Creative reserves the right to add and charge fees not specifically listed above.</p>

    <h3><a name="failureToPay">12.  Failure to Pay</a></h3>
    <p>If Buyer becomes responsible under this Agreement to make any payments to KNN Creative and fails to pay such amounts when due, Buyer shall be responsible to KNN Creative for all amounts due, plus any applicable processing fees, charges or penalties, collection costs (including but not limited to attorneys’ fees), and interest on the unpaid amount at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum allowed by law. In its discretion, and without limiting its other available remedies, KNN Creative may setoff amounts due from Buyer against amounts received from or held for Buyer, and may make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies.</p>
    <p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or the availability of other remedies, in the event that Buyer fails to make any payment to KNN Creative when due, Buyer consents to (a) KNN Creative directing any Payment Processor to withhold payments, or any portion thereof, otherwise due to Buyer, and to pay withheld amounts to KNN Creative to setoff, in whole or in part, amounts owed to KNN Creative; (b) Payment Processor complying with such direction; and (c) KNN Creative or Payment Processor charging any Buyer credit cards, bank accounts, or other payment methods or sources available to KNN Creative amounts due from Buyer.</p>

    <h3><a name="feedbackReputation">14.  Feedback and Reputation Management</a></h3>
    <p>KNN Creative provides its feedback and reputation management system as a service to Buyer and other Users, through which Users can express their opinions and experiences publicly about other Users. KNN Creative does not monitor or censor these statements, or investigate any remarks posted by Users for accuracy. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Site may contain publicly available comments and feedback about Buyer from other Users with whom Buyer has transacted or interacted through and in connection with the Site. Buyer acknowledges that feedback results for Buyer may consist of comments and ratings left by other Users that are or that Buyer perceives as negative. Buyer also acknowledges and agrees that KNN Creative may (but shall have no obligation to) calculate composite feedback numbers, scores, or other ratings based on User feedback. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall KNN Creative be responsible or liable for, and Buyer releases KNN Creative and holds KNN Creative harmless from, any claims that Buyer might have as a result of any other User’s comments or feedback about Buyer, or any scores, numbers, ratings or other data or information derived from User comments or feedback, even if that information is defamatory or otherwise legally actionable.</p>
    <p>Buyer understands and agrees that Buyer may be held legally responsible to other Users, KNN Creative, or third parties as a result of comments or feedback that Buyer submits to the Site. Any effort to falsify feedback, or to manipulate or coerce another User by threatening negative feedback or offering to sell or buy goods or services in exchange for feedback is in violation of this Agreement, and may expose Buyer to liability. Other actions that constitute an abuse of the reputation management system and a violation of this Agreement include, but are not limited to, submitting to the feedback system links, profanity, or inappropriate content, shilling - the creation of fraudulent positive reviews designed to inflate a shop's reputation, and contacting Users to provide direct feedback about other Users with whom Buyer has interacted, whether or not that feedback is negative.</p>
    <p>KNN Creative shall at all times have the right, in its sole discretion, to maintain, modify, or delete statements, feedback, comments, or ratings, although shall have no obligation to do so.</p>
    <p>KNN Creative shall at all times have the right, in its sole discretion, to determine how search algorithms through the Site will function, including but not limited to determining the manner in which Makers and Makers’ portfolios rank and are listed in response to User searches, and which Project Requests Makers are able to view or respond to.</p>


    <h3><a name="disputeResolution">15.  Resolution of a Dispute with a Maker</a></h3>
    <p>If you have an issue with a project, we recommend contacting the Maker you purchased from to inform them of your issue.  Makers are typically able to work with you quickly to get issues resolved.</p>
    <p>In cases where you are having difficulty reaching an agreement with your Maker, you have the option of participating in KNN Creative’s Dispute Resolution Process.  KNN Creative is under no obligation to provide dispute resolution.  KNN Creative hosts this process as a benefit to Buyers and Makers at KNN Creative’s sole discretion. If KNN Creative attempts to resolve a dispute between you and your Maker, it does so on a good faith basis based on KNN Creative’s policies and the information contained in your correspondence with your Maker on KNN Creative.  Please note that KNN Creative does not guarantee projects in any way.</p>
    <p>If you believe you have been defrauded by a Maker, in addition to notifying KNN Creative, you should also report the incident to law enforcement as applicable.  If you believe you have a civil claim for damages against a Maker, you should pursue that claim through the judicial system. KNN Creative is not equipped to adjudicate legal claims.</p>
    <p>If you have a dispute with KNN Creative, please see Section #26.</p>

    <h3><a name="release">16.  Release</a></h3>
    <p>Buyer agrees that by entering into this Agreement, Buyer, for Buyer and Buyer’s predecessors, successors, and assigns (together, the “Buyer Releasors”), releases and forever discharges KNN Creative and its predecessors, successors, assigns, agents, officers, directors, employees subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, attorneys, contractors, and suppliers (together, the “KNN Creative Releasees”) from and against all actions, causes of action, claims, suits, debts, damages, judgments, liabilities, rights, contracts, obligations, and demands, whether now known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, that any of the Buyer Releasors has, may have, has asserted, or could have asserted, of any nature and relating to any subject, excluding the right of Buyer to enforce this Agreement according to its terms.</p>
